      <p>
        Encompass is an analytics and mapping tool built by {bayesLink} that enables policymakers, researchers, and consumer advocates to analyze how accessibility
        to social services varies across demographic groups. Inadequate and untimely access to health care services is a major barrier to health equity for disadvantaged
        communities. Existing tools used to map systems at this scale are prohibitively expensive, require significant amounts of manual data processing, and are too
        coarse to accurately depict accessibility issues. We set out to build a solution that eliminates those barriers.
