        Encompass is a geographic analysis tool built by {bayesLink}. The application uses {ghslLink} to
        estimate the geographic distribution of people around the world. Encompass then uses a variety of open data sources and
        open-source technology,
        including {usCensusLink} and the {osrmLink}, to calculate driving times
        between critical social services and the people they are meant to serve.
      </p>
      <p>
        The primary intent for this project is to assist researchers, policymakers, and consumer advocates in measuring
        geographic accessibility to
        identify existing gaps and plan strategic interventions. While the potential applications of this technology are broad, our
        team is most excited about how
        this tool can be used to promote health equity.
