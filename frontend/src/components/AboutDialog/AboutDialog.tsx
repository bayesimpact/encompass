        Encompass is a geographic analysis tool built by {bayesLink}. The application processes {ghslLink} from the
        European Commission
        to approximate the location of people across the world. Encompass then uses a variety of open data sources and
        open-source technology,
        including {usCensusLink} and the Open Source Routing Machine ({osrmLink}), to calculate the driving times
        between critical social services and the people they are meant to serve.

      <p>
        The primary intent for this project is to assist researchers, policymakers, and consumer advocates in measuring
        geographic accessibility to
        identify gaps and plan for strategic interventions. While the applications of this technology are broad, our
        team is most excited about how
        this can be used to promote health equity.
