/**
 * A big generic partially appliable reducer for building math pipelines.
 *
 * It accepts an `initial` value, a reducer `f`, a plucker `g` that
 * takes an object of type `T` and gives a numerical property on it,
 * and an array of `data`. We take advantage of Lodash's loop fusion
 * to do a map and reduce in *O(n)* time.
 *
 * We round the result, because floating point math is not always
 * accurate (.1 + .2 === 0.30000000000000004).
